                <p>
                    Thank you for visiting Sama, this is CEO Ha Sang-yong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1969, our company was founded with the ambition to contribute towards Korea’s economy by becoming more self-sufficient in the aluminium foil industry through localization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the past 50 years, we have been able to achieve ground-breaking technologies that led to the introduction of various innovative aluminium applications such as Korea’s first retortable pouch, <span class="nowrap">4.5㎛</span> ultra-thin gauge aluminium foil, and the world’s first <span class="nowrap">10㎛</span> ultra high-strength LIB cathode foil.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In addition to Sama’s current portfolio of aluminium foil, packaging, and industrial materials, we are now preparing for yet another leap by building the world`s best, state-of-the-art production base and expanding into the specialty films and electronic components business.
                </p>
                <p>
                   We will continue to push ourselves beyond the limits to provide better, more sustainable solutions that enhance people’s lives. Based on the trust of our customers and business partners, we will give our best to become a leading global company that brings happiness to people all around the world.
